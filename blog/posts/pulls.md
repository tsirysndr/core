We've spent the last couple of weeks building out a pull
request system for Tangled, and today we want to lift the
hood and show you how it works.

If you're new to Tangled, [read our intro](/intro) for the
full story!

You have three options to contribute to a repository:

- Paste a patch on the web UI
- Compare two local branches (you'll see this only if you're a
collaborator on the repo)
- Compare across forks

Whatever you choose, at the core of every PR is the patch.
First, you write some code. Then, you run `git diff` to
produce a patch and make everyone's lives easier, or push to
a branch, and we generate it ourselves by comparing against
the target.

## patch generation

When you create a PR from a branch, we create a "patch" by
calculating the difference between your branch and the
target branch. Consider this scenario:

<figure class="max-w-[550px] m-auto flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
  <img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="https://assets.tangled.network/blog/merge-base.png">
  <figcaption class="text-center"><code>A</code> is the merge-base for
<code>feature</code> and <code>main</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

Your `feature` branch has advanced 2 commits since you first
branched out, but in the meanwhile, `main` has also advanced
2 commits. Doing a trivial `git diff feature main` will
produce a confusing patch:

- the patch will apply the changes from `X` and `Y`
- the patch will **revert** the changes from `B` and `C`

We obviously do not want the second part! To only show the
changes added by `feature`, we have to identify the
"merge-base": the nearest common ancestor of `feature` and
`main`.


In this case, `A` is the nearest common ancestor, and
subsequently, the patch calculated will contain just `X` and
`Y`.

### ref comparisons across forks

The plumbing described above is easy to do across two
branches, but what about forks? And what if they live on
different servers altogether (as they can in Tangled!)?

Here's the concept: since we already have all the necessary
components to compare two local refs, why not simply
"localize" the remote ref?

In simpler terms, we instruct Git to fetch the target branch
from the original repository and store it in your fork under
a special name. This approach allows us to compare your
changes against the most current version of the branch
you're trying to contribute to, all while remaining within
your fork.

<figure class="max-w-[550px] m-auto flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
    <img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="https://assets.tangled.network/blog/hidden-ref.png">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Hidden tracking ref.</figcaption>
</figure>

We call this a "hidden tracking ref." When you create a pull
request from a fork, we establish a refspec that tracks the
remote branch, which we then use to generate a diff. A
refspec is essentially a rule that tells Git how to map
references between a remote and your local repository during
fetch or push operations.

For example, if your fork has a feature branch called
`feature-1`, and you want to make a pull request to the
`main` branch of the original repository, we fetch the
remote `main` into a local hidden ref using a refspec like
this:

```
+refs/heads/main:refs/hidden/feature-1/main
```

Since we already have a remote (`origin`, by default) to the
original repository (remember, we cloned it earlier), we can
use `fetch` with this refspec to bring the remote `main`
branch into our local hidden ref. Each pull request gets its
own hidden ref, hence the `refs/hidden/:localRef/:remoteRef`
format. We keep this ref updated whenever you push new
commits to your feature branch, ensuring that comparisons --
and any potential merge conflicts -- are always based on the
latest state of the target branch.

And just like earlier, we produce the patch by diffing your
feature branch with the hidden tracking ref. Also, the entire pull
request is stored as [an atproto record][atproto-record] and updated
each time the patch changes.

[atproto-record]: https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:qfpnj4og54vl56wngdriaxug/sh.tangled.repo.pull/3lmwniim2i722

Neat, now that we have a patch; we can move on the hard
part: code review.


## your patch does the rounds

Tangled uses a "round-based" review format. Your initial
submission starts "round 0". Once your submission receives
scrutiny, you can address reviews and resubmit your patch.
This resubmission starts "round 1". You keep whittling on
your patch till it is good enough, and eventually merged (or
closed if you are unlucky).

    <img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="https://assets.tangled.network/blog/patch-pr-main.png">
    <figcaption class="text-center">A new pull request with a couple
rounds of reviews.</figcaption>
</figure>

Rounds are a far superior to standard branch-based
approaches:

- Submissions are immutable: how many times have your
  reviews gone out-of-date because the author pushed commits
  _during_ your review?
- Reviews are attached to submissions: at a glance, it is
  easy to tell which comment applies to which "version" of
  the pull-request
- The author can choose when to resubmit! They can commit as
  much as they want to their branch, but a new round begins
  when they choose to hit "resubmit"
- It is possible to "interdiff" and observe changes made
  across submissions (this is coming very soon to Tangled!)

This [post by Mitchell
Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/writing/github-changesets)
goes into further detail on what can be achieved with
round-based reviews.

## future plans

To close off this post, we wanted to share some of our
future plans for pull requests:

* `format-patch` support: both for pasting in the UI and
  internally. This allows us to show commits in the PR page,
  and offer different merge strategies to choose from
  (squash, rebase, ...).
  **Update 2025-08-12**: We have format-patch support!

* Gerrit-style `refs/for/main`: we're still hashing out the
  details but being able to push commits to a ref to
  "auto-create" a PR would be super handy!

* Change ID support: This will allow us to group changes
  together and track them across multiple commits, and to
  provide "history" for each change. This works great with [Jujutsu][jj].
  **Update 2025-08-12**: This has now landed: https://blog.tangled.org/stacking

Join us on [Discord](https://chat.tangled.sh) or
`#tangled` on libera.chat (the two are bridged, so we will
never miss a message!). We are always available to help
setup knots, listen to feedback on features, or even
shepherd contributions!

**Update 2025-08-12**: We move fast, and we now have jujutsu support, and an
early in-house CI: https://blog.tangled.org/ci. You no longer need a Bluesky
account to sign-up; head to https://tangled.sh/signup and sign up with your
email!
